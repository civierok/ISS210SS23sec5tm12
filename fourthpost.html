                        <p>Imagine if education was not a burden. As someone who has access to an education, and probably money to support themselves it is hard to understand if there were complications in the mix. Think long and hard; has there ever been a time, outside of university, where you or a family member had been barely able to keep up with their minimal expenses?</p>
                        <p>Not to assume but the answer that probably comes to mind is that you have never had to deal with this certain situation ever in your life. Sure the costs of university are high but take that out of the equation; the likelihood that a student like yourself has dealt with poverty is low.</p>
                        <p>This page of the blog post will focus on the science impacts of poverty on a students education namely; anatomy of the body and in school participation.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="Second Heading">How is this impacting partcipation in lecture and grades?</h2>
                        <p>For resources for at home help; approximately ¾ of households do have access to high speed internet and computers; however, the parents are therefore forced to work for longer hours or even multiple jobs to afford the fees. To add to the dilemma for school districts the funding is based on property taxes. However, the school districts with almost all of the families in poverty are put at a disadvantage. These schools have little to no access to resources due to the low funding. On top of that, low funding affects the professors that are hired. Low income families are more than likely to be taught by professors that are inexperienced and frankly less effective. </p>
                        <p>Data supports that nearly ⅕ of students nationwide live in poverty, attend a high poverty school or both.  </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">In an article it mentions, “...Some factors that come into play with students suffering in poverty are as follows: health issues from non nutritional diet, homelessness, lack of food, or even the inability to receive medical treatment for illnesses”. 
</blockquote>
                        <p>This being said the consequences are simple as increased stress on homework and fewer resources at home that might aid in success at school,during the day,as well as for studying at night. 
</p>
                        <h2 class="Third heading">What happens to the body when you do not eat?</h2>
                        <p>Each blog post should include an image and a PDF or a video. Included in the following lines is the code for including an image. In the link below, include your pdf. The image is the source, labeled src below. You simply have to follow the directory path to replace the image. The directory path as is is stating you will find this image if you go to assets, then image, and there you will find the image I have called. This must be the exact path. Changing punctutation or capitalization will mean the site cannot find your picture. Remember, machines are incredibly literal.</p

                        <p>This video provides a background into the processes that occur in your body with and without food.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you may also include a video. Not every member has to do all three. Choose whether you want a video to cite and unpack or a PDF. If it is a video, you only need to include the video and information about it (your summary). If it is a PDF, you should include a picture.</p>
