                        <p>Many studies have been conducted to determine the effect that poverty has on a adult productivity. The largest contributing factor to the decreased adult productivity of those who lived or grew up in poverty is the undeniable fact that the education in poorer areas is lacking.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of race or heritage, growing up in poverty-stricken family will likely reduce a man's wages by 25-40%. This trend stands for women too, but fewer and smaller studies are done in that category. </p>
                        <p>Attendance and the presence of a school within a community does not guarantee learning. Poorer schools may be required to follow the same cirriculums as their wealthier counterparts, but underpaid teachers and a lack of resources can lead to corner-cutting and teachers having received less education themselves.</p>
                        <p>Students that live in low-income areas and attend schools with mediocre teaching have fewer successful alumni to look up to. Generations of subpar achievement by students of these schools leads the students to believe there is a ceiling for them. Few successful alumni means that there is likely to be fewer donations to the school, which can result in an ever larger gap between the education of rich and the poor.</p>
                        <p>Students in low-income areas also tend to have modest aspirations. A poor financial situation gives students a mindset that is is likely to limit their life achievements.</p>

                        <p>Their challenges intersect with your life more than you typically consider. Those in tough situations can cause markets to plummet and crime rates to rise</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Because children become adults and are future producers, taxpayers, citizens, and voters, as a society we need to be concerned that childhood poverty can be an severe impediment to growth and development. To the extent that childhood poverty reduces an individualâ€™s subsequent capacity for serving important adulthood roles, it can mean a handicapped work force, an ill-prepared electorate, and possibly substantial public expenditures. 
</blockquote>
                        <p>Instead of ignoring the root of so many families' problems and instead supplementing their low wages with tax dollars, it would be better if that money was spent on improving the education systems of low-income areas.</p>

                        <p>This video by aha! showcases the positive feedback loop that can be seen in poorer communities</p>

                        <p>As illustrated in the video above, the struggles relating to poverty, education, and mindset do not have a set order. Everyone's story is a little bit different when they live in such conditions. </p>
                        <p>These environments and effects of previous struggles can lead to positive feedback loops. Eventually, a person's drive, education, and life structure falls much to far below disirable and they are likely to adopt an acceptance of failure.</p>
