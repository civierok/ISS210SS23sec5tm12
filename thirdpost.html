                        <p>The income gaps in rich countries, like Canada, have been widening, and it affects the efficiency of children in schools in the past decade. This hurts families because children's educational outcome is a huge determiner for financial survival.</p>
                        <p>The Ontario Child Health Study in the 80s states that there are associations between low income and mental illness, and chronic physical health problems in children. When children don't have the proper financial standing they can't get the medicine they need. With the financial stress, it affects their mental health, which affects their academics.</p>
                        <p>Poverty hurts a child's school readiness because of their home life which is hurt by poverty, along with health, and the neighborhoods they live in. When a child doesn't get the right amount of stimulation from their home life, it's hard for them to focus on school and develope proper social skills.</p>
                        <p>According to The Institution of Research and Public Policy, children who are impoverished are less likely to pass standard tests, and they also score lower on vocabulary tests.</p>
                        <p>Children in poverty are set up for failure. They're not given the stable home life to succeed. They don't have the physical health to be present in classes, and neither do they have the mental health. Many students may be in class physically, but are they really present? Every child in every country should be given the opportunity to academically grow with one another.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Calls to Action</h2>
                        <p>You can Visit the NCCP (National Center for Children in Poverty) for more information on what you can do to help child poverty. They're a non-profit organization. They help with the physical and mental health for children, and minorities such as POC, immigrants, people with disabilities, and women.</p>
                        <p>This means your headings should not say second heading.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">You may copy or replace this code if you want to quote someone. Four lines of quotation or more (on the page) should be in block quotes, which is why these containers are called block quotes. Not creative but effective.</blockquote>
                        <p>Remember to always unpack a block quote. You should leave the reader remembering your voice, not someone else's.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Effects</h2>
                        <p>Poverty effects children in a lot more ways than just their education. They can feel left out, they could be picked on for what they're wearing, their worries could be focused on things that children shouldn't be stressed about too. They can have low self esteem and low self worth. Children in poverty also miss out on a lot of childhood experiences, like going on field trips. Going on field trips often times costs money. Money the parents don't have, so the children end up losing an opportunity. All of these things effect children heavily. Growing up like this makes it harder to be a functioning adult, too. The longterm effects poverty has on youth takes a life-time to heal from.</p>

                        <p>Just like a quote, you should not leave an image resting there. Say something about what the image does for your site.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you may also include a video. Not every member has to do all three. Choose whether you want a video to cite and unpack or a PDF. If it is a video, you only need to include the video and information about it (your summary). If it is a PDF, you should include a picture.</p>
